1) DISTINCT
-Removes duplicate entries from the result set.
-Ensures unique values in the selected column(s).

SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;

2) ORDER BY
-Sorts records in ascending order (ASC) by default.
-Sorts records in descending order (DESC) if specified.

SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC; -- Ascending order
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC; -- Descending order

Note:

ASC (Ascending) is the default sorting order.
DESC (Descending) sorts values from highest to lowest.


3) LIMIT
-Restricts the number of rows returned in the query result.
-Useful when fetching a specific number of records.

SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT n;

SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 5; -- Retrieves only the first 5 records
