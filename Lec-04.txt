
1)UPDATE-The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

UPDATE employee set name='mahesh' where id=1


2)DELETE -The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table.

DELETE from employee where id=1; 

DELETE from employee;(delete all column )


3)ALTER 

The ALTER statement is used to modify the schema (structure) of an existing table.

Alter Table employee add column jobtiltle varchar(50) not null;  --> add column

ALTER table employee drop column jobtilte      ---> drop column

ALTER table employee modify column name varchar(60)----> modify column

ALTER table employee drop primary key-----> drop primary key

ALTER table emloyee add primary key(id)-----> add primary key



DDL vs DML in SQL
1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL is used to define, modify, or delete the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and schemas. It does not manipulate the actual data within the tables.

Examples of DDL Commands:
CREATE → Creates a new table, database, or index.

ALTER → Modifies the structure of an existing table (e.g., adding or removing columns).

DROP → Deletes an entire table or database permanently.

TRUNCATE → Removes all records from a table but retains its structure.

Note on TRUNCATE:

TRUNCATE internally drops and recreates the table.
It is faster than DELETE because it does not log individual row deletions.
It cannot be rolled back as it is auto-committed.

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML is used to manipulate the actual data inside database tables. It allows users to insert, update, or delete records while keeping the table structure unchanged.

Examples of DML Commands:

INSERT → Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE → Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE → Removes specific records from a table while keeping its structure intact.

DML commands can be rolled back, unlike most DDL commands, making them transaction-safe.
