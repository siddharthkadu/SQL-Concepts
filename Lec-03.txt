CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that can be performed on a database.

1.) Create (INSERT Statement)
Used to add new records to a table.

2.) Read (SELECT Statement)
Used to retrieve existing records from a table.

3.) Update (UPDATE Statement)
Used to modify existing records in a table.

4.) Delete (DELETE Statement)
Used to remove records from a table.

(A) Creation of Table and INSERT Statements

Employee Table
(Assumption: You prefer to hire employees from Bangalore by default)


CREATE TABLE employee (
    firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    middlename VARCHAR(50),
    lastname VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    salary INT,
    location VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Bangalore'
);


(B) Inserting Values into Employee Table


INSERT INTO employee (firstname, middlename, lastname, age, salary, location)
VALUES ('Siddharth', 'Dinesh', 'Kadu', 24, 10000000, 'Pune');



(C) Primary Key Concept

A Primary Key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row has a unique value and cannot be NULL.

Creating a Table with Primary Key

CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
);

Alternative Syntax

CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

Inserting Data into Table with Primary Key


INSERT INTO employee (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Siddharth', 24);


(D) Auto Increment Concept

AUTO_INCREMENT ensures that each new row gets a unique, automatically incrementing value for the primary key column.

Creating a Table with Auto-Increment Primary Key

CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
);


(E) Unique Key Concept

A Unique Key ensures that a column has unique values across all rows. Unlike a primary key, it can contain NULL values.

Example of Unique Key Constraint


CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
);

Primary Key: Can only be one per table, must be unique, and cannot be NULL.
Unique Key: Can have multiple unique keys in a table and allows NULL values.
